# Step 2: Breaking up the game
When you created the memory card game in [the original assignment](https://github.com/MicheleCynowicz/memory-card-game), you started by creating an HTML file with an empty game board. Then you proceeded to add a `<ul>` tag with 16 `<li>` tags inside of it, to represent each card. Inside each `<li class="card">` you had 2 `<div>` tags to represent the front and the back of each card.

There's a LOT of repetitive code in that `index.html` file. In programming we use the term DRY, which is an acronym for [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://medium.com/0xcode/dry-dont-repeat-yourself-avoiding-redundancy-in-software-programming-e264ec97276e). We will use individual Vue components to break apart the HTML from the `index.html` file, so that we can have less code hard-coded, and thus our app will adhere to the DRY principle.

Once we have small, separate components, the [compiler](https://www.w3schools.in/what-is-compiler) can build our game board for us, by stacking components as if they were LEGO bricks.

Now you'll create two single file components (SFCs, or `.vue` files) to represent parts of the game's original markup, based on this breakdown:
- card view (back or front, to represent the `<div>` tags inside each `<li>`)
- game board to hold the cards markup (as in the `<li class="card">` tags)

In your `src/components` directory, create two new SFC files: `GameBoard.vue`, and  `CardView.vue`.

*NOTE* that the name `CardView.vue` is a tad wordy, we might have preferred to call this simply `Card.vue`. However, Vue's styleguide and linting recommendations dictate that component names that are not `App.vue` should always be multi-word names. If you tried to name the file `Card.vue`, you might see a syntax error in your code editor because the filename is too short.

In each of your 2 new files, add the following code:
```html
<script>
  export default {};
</script>

<template>
</template>

```

Within each `<template></template>` tag in each file, add a `<p>` tag to name the current component, such as:
```html
<template>
  <p>I am the GameBoard.vue component</p>
</template>
```
This way you will be able to see how they are output by the compiler once they each are being called by a component instance within the app.

In order to see these components in the browser, they need to be called upon within the app.

In your `App.vue` file, within the `<script setup> ... </script>` tag, remove the 2 default component import statements and add:
```js
import GameBoard from "./components/GameBoard.vue";
```

Next, inside of `App.vue`, remove the `<header></header>` tag and all of its contents. Change the content of the `<main></main>` tag to a component instance of the game board, like this:
```html
<main>
  <GameBoard />
</main>
```

The whole `<template>` tag in your `App.vue` file should look like this:
```html
<template>
  <main>
    <GameBoard />
  </main>
</template>
```

Now look at the app as it is running at localhost (if it is not running, you will need to use the terminal command `npm run dev` to start it). The only content you should see on the screen now is the `<p>` tag from inside of your `GameBoard.vue` component, such as *I am the GameBoard.vue component*.

Inside of the `GameBoard.vue` component, add an `import` statement to the `<script>` tag to import the `CardView.vue` component, above the `export default {};` line like this:
```html
<script>
import CardView from "./CardView.vue";

export default {};
</script>
```
Within the `export default {};` object, add a `components: {},` property, and call the `CardView` component within the `components` object, like this:
```js
export default {
  components: {
    CardView,
  },
};
```
This is how you register the child component `CardView` inside the parent component, `GameBoard`.

Next you'll call an instance of the `CardView` component inside the `<template>` tag, below your `<p>` tag, using the component instance syntax `<CardView />`.

Your `GameBoard.vue` file's `<template>` tag should now look something like this:
```html
<template>
  <p>I am the GameBoard.vue component</p>
  <CardView />
</template>
```
*Oh Noes! A syntax error!* Due to the way in which VueJS 2.0 compiles components, it requires that there is only _one single HTML element in the template root_. The `<template>` tag will not actually render in the compiled code, so VueJS 2.0 is looking for all the content within the `<template>` tag to be wrapped in a tag that _will_ render. (This has been changed in VueJS 3.0)

Update the `<template>` tag code in your `GameBoard.vue` file to include a `<div>` to wrap the content, like this:
```html
<template>
  <div>
    <p>I am the GameBoard.vue component</p>
    <CardView />
  </div>
</template>
```
When you look at this in your browser at localhost, you should now see the text *I am the GameBoard.vue component* followed by *I am the CardView.vue component*.

Now you want to make the HTML render in a way that looks like the HTML from your original Memory Game project's `index.html`. This means you need to add the `game-board` class to the `<div>` tag in your `GameBoard.vue` component, and wrap `<ul class="cards">` and `<li class="card">` tags around the `<CardView />` component instance:
```html
<template>
  <div class="game-board">
    <p>I am the GameBoard.vue component</p>
    <ul class="cards">
      <li class="card">
        <CardView />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>
```
This doesn't change much in the app when viewed in the browser, but upon inspecting the page with dev tools, you will see the added class name `game-board` and the added `<ul class="cards">` and `<li class="card">` tags.

Speaking of what you see in the browser, you've got some lingering styles from the boilerplate of the VueJS setup, so go into your `App.vue` component and remove the entire `<style scoped> ... </style>` tag. Once you save this and look at it in the browser, there are still boilerplate styles present! *Where do they come from?*

Open the file `main.js` from the `src` directory. At line 4 you should see:
```js
import "./assets/main.css";
```
Change this import to directly reference your `style.css` file copy in your `static_site` directory, like this:
```js
import "../static_site/style.css";
```
Now you should see your app in the browser starting to take shape!
