# Memory Card Game, built in Vue
To get started in this project, you need to have completed the original Memory Card Game assignment. If you have that project complete, you can begin following this assignment.

## Setup your project
In a terminal window, `cd` (change directory) to the parent directory of your new project. Run the command `npm init vue@2`. Follow the CLI prompts to setup a Vue project, with these settings:

✔ Project name: `memory-card-game-vue`
✔ Add TypeScript? `No`
✔ Add JSX Support? `No`
✔ Add Vue Router for Single Page Application development? `No`
✔ Add Pinia for state management? `No`
✔ Add Vitest for Unit Testing? `No`
✔ Add Cypress for both Unit and End-to-End testing? `No`
✔ Add ESLint for code quality? `Yes`
✔ Add Prettier for code formatting? `Yes`

Follow the prompts provided by the CLI to `cd` into the project directory, run an `npm install`, then an `npm lint`.

You do not need to run `npm run dev` yet. This command will start your project running on a localhost port. You will use this later.

Publish this new project as a git repository on GitHub (in VS Code you can do this via the Source Control panel).

Move on to [Step 1](/step-1).
